**Season:** Fall Semester 2019

**Description:** This workshop is an interactive and hands-on demonstration of how the web development process works. They will start with website information, images, text, and tools from a client to experience how someone would put it all together to make an appealing web page. The workshop will be a preview of design principles and techniques such as contrast, alignment, color, and proximity while learning Illustrator. The last few weeks will focus on bringing the design to life with code.
